# ZoKudos App
ZoKudos is a PixeLAW App of the ZoKudos community. The App generates a community field within the PixeLAW world of size `field_size`. Once a field is generated by a community members, other community members can interact with the state of the field and modify it.

> A ZoKudos community member is a person owning a ZoKudos briq NFT in their wallet.

## Current Implementation
Currently anyone that uses the ZoKudos app can create a ZoKudos community field if pixel space is available. Additionally, if anyone clicks into a ZoKudos community field, the person can change the color within the field. That means that in this WIP implementation there is no check for ZoKudos ownership.

## Open App Design Questions
- What kind of restrictions should exist to create a ZoKudos community field within PixeLAW? (Can any ZoKudos owner create a new field? Should there only be one field or can more exist in parallel?)
- If clicked into an existing ZoKudos field, what should the ZoKudos owner be able to do? (Currently the community member, can simply paint the space of the community field and/or paint over other pixels.)

## ToDo's
- add code based on questions above.
- write tests
